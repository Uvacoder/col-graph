  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Inspired by <a href="https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com" target="_blank"
      >Six Degrees of Wikipedia</a
    >, Six Degress of Formula 1 stores data of over 800 drivers, who are
    connected together by about 5000 links. If two drivers competed for the same
    team in at least one race, there's a link between them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter the names of two F1 drivers, and you'll be shown how to get from one
    to the other using as few connections as possible.
